# Free Editor Zoom
###### requested by [WDWiktor](user:10929123)

Makes it so you can zoom <cj>in</c> and <co>out</c>... a **lot** more than before.

Also adds a <c-c7c7c7>button</c> to the editor pause menu to <cc>reset position</c> if you're [stupid](user:10929123) enough to <cr>completely obliterate</c> scale limits.

That's it waow, check the settings btw they have a bunch of customizable stuff!!!
